Volleyball is a fast-paced sport that is quickly growing in popularity.  Every point in volleyball begins with a serve. An experiment was done to see if there is a way to improve traditional coaching techniques in order to help more people learn quickly how to serve accurately.  The experiment consisted of subjects serving four rounds of ten serves at a target to test accuracy.  Feedback from a coach was given between rounds in conjunction with video playback of the subject serving.  Each serve was given a score from zero to ten based on how close to the center of the target the serve landed.  Each round score was then created by computing the sum of all scores from that round.  A percent growth calculation was then used to measure growth after receiving feedback.  Each server received both types of video playback, the traditional color video or body indexing: a process of creating an animated model of the limbs and joints that connect them.  A matched pairs test was run on the differences between servers growth from each type of playback.  The analysis concluded that neither form of playback was statistically superior to the other.
